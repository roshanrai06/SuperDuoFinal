# Udacity SuperDuo!


###Welcome to the SuperDuo! project
This repository actually contains 2 projects; the _**Alexandria**_ app that allows for scanning and maintaining a list of books, and the _**FootbalScores**_ app where we can follow soccer matches and their results. This Readme show the release notes of both apps, beginning with the Alexandria app.


##Alexandria 1.1
_**The Alexandria Android app allows for scanning and maintaining a list of books**_

This application retrieves book information from the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/). All titles, cover images, and author information come from there. The original version of this app was built by Sascha Jaschke, and a modified version is given to students in the Udacity Android Nanodegree program.

##FootballScores 1.1
_**With the FootballScores app we can follow soccer matches and their results**_


The Football Scores app uses the Football-data.org Api to retrieve the fixtures- and teams data. To be able to use it you need to request an Api Key at: [http://api.football-data.org/register](http://api.football-data.org/register). After you've received the key you need to enter it in the app Settings.
